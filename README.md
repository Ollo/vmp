#### Development

Install node and npm. I personally use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

After cloning the repo run:

```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed you can use gulp for css compliation

```

gulp sass // compile manually

gulp watch // watch _partials for changes
```
